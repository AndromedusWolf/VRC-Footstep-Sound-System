# VRC-Footstep-Sound-System

## Overview
This is a system that allows you to quickly and easily add sounds to a player's footsteps when walking on a surface. For example, you can have a player make wooden floor footstep sounds when walking on a wooden floor.

This is being made free to use by the community and you may alter and improve the package as you wish. All I ask is that, if you alter the package and wish to distribute it, that you do so freely. There is no need to credit me, you may do so if you wish however.


## Dependencies
It is VERY important that you have [Udonsharp](https://github.com/vrchat-community/UdonSharp) downloaded already before downloading this package! The Footstep Sound System package won't work without it!


## Set-Up
1. Once you've imported or setup the Udonsharp package, import the Footstep Sound System package into Unity.
2. Open the Footstep Sound System folder and drag out the prefab

3. Once you've done that, you are largely done! All you have to do now is assign Audio Sources to the surfaces that will be walked on.
